class CardGame

  def checkforAce(card)
    #checkforAce should be check_for_ace
    if card.value = 1
    # = should be ==
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  #dif should be def
  #card1 card2 needs a comma
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
    #card should be card1
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end
#too many ends, should be at the very end of the file

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  #total should be total = 0
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
    #return needs to be after end and total needs to be converted to string
  end
end

#end of file needs an end
```
